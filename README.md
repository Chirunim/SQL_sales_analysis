💡 **INSIGHTS**

💡 **INSIGHTS:**

- Majority (70%+) of users fall into the high-balance segment.

- Even high-balance users are making late payments — this points to behavioral, not income-related, payment issues.



  

✅ **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- Introduce persona-based messaging for high-balance customers.

- Offer tailored perks for good behavior — e.g., waived fees or interest discounts.

- Use educational content for low-balance users to build credit health.




4. **📈 ACCOUNT BALANCES ACROSS AGES**

- Older age groups (60–65) have the highest average balances (e.g., £4,800+).

- Surprisingly, young teens (e.g., age 13) also have high balances — likely family or custodial accounts.

✅ **RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- Offer premium products to high-value senior customers.

- Review young customer accounts for accuracy and marketing potential.

- Segment users by both age and balance to better match products and services.

💡 **INSIGHTS:**

- 18–25 group is the most delayed — over 51 days overdue on average.

- 26–35 is the best-performing group in terms of timely payments.

All other groups hover around 45–47 days overdue, regardless of income or balance.



✅ **RECOMMENDATIONS**

- Target the 18–25 segment with educational campaigns, low-risk credit options, or gamified early payment challenges.

- Use 26–35 group behavior as a model — analyze what’s working (e.g., mobile reminders, flexible plans).

- Offer personalized support to seniors, including simplified UX and timely reminders.






📌 **CONCLUSIONS: STRATEGIC TAKEAWAYS**

- Late payments are a behavioral issue, not a financial capacity one.

- Text-based outreach is your best tool for collections — double down on this.

- Segment by age and balance simultaneously to personalize marketing, support, and financial products.

- Implement data-backed retention campaigns for high-value customers — especially in the 60+ age group.

- Build a payment incentive structure (e.g., rewards, discounts, gamified savings) to reverse poor repayment habits.
